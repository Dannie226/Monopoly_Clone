# Monopoly, But Comprimises Were Made

## Licensing info
All licensing info can be found [here](./resources/licensing.md)

## How To Play The Game
The full game should always be up on [github pages](https://dannie226.github.io/Monopoly_Clone/src/main.html)  

Alternitively, you can clone the repo, and host it on a personal server.  

Requires as many controllers as you have players, and if you are in a browser that has an array of numbers for Gamepad.buttons, I am sorry for your loss.

Have Fun.
